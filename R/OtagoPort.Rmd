# Introduction

Welcome to `posterdown` ! This is my attempt to provide a semi-smooth workflow for those who wish to take their `RMarkdown` skills to the conference world. Many creature comforts from `RMarkdown` are available in this package such as `Markdown` section notation, figure captioning, and even citations like this one [@Abbot2017] The rest of this example poster will show how you can insert typical conference poster features into your own document. 

### Rancid - Roots Radicals

Took the 60 bus
Out of downtown Campbell.
Ben Zanotto, he was on there
He was waitin' for me
All the punk rockers
And the moon stompers
Are out on the corners
Where they're sparing for change

I started thinkin'.
You know I started drinkin'.
I don't remember too much of that day.
Somethin' struck me funny
When we ran out of money
Where do you go now when your only 15?

With the music execution (ohhh)
And the talk of revolution
It bleeds in me
Oh and it goes

Give 'em the boot; the roots, the radicals
Give 'em the boot; you know I'm a radical
Give 'em the boot; the roots, the reggae on my
Stereo

The radio was playin', Desmond Dekker was singin'
On the 43 bus as we climb up the hill
Nothin' incoming but the reggae drummin',
And we all come from unloving homes.
I said; "Why even bother" and I pick up the bottle
Mr. Bus driver please let these people on
Rude girl Carol was a mini-skirt girl
My blurry vision saw nothin' wrong

With the music execution (ohhh)
And the talk of revolution
It bleeds in me
Oh and it goes

Give 'em the boot; the roots, the radicals
Give 'em the boot; you know I'm a radical
Give 'em the boot; the roots, the reggae on my
Stereo

On my stereo!
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah!

# Study Site

Here is a map made to show the study site using `ggplot2`, `ggspatial`, and `sf` and you can even reference this with a hyperlink, this will take you to **Figure \ref{mymapfig}**. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [@Abbot2017] consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 
\vspace{1cm}

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.cap='This is a map of Canada, the ggspatial package is great for GIS folks in R! \\label{mymapfig}', cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggspatial)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(sf)

canada <- read_sf("../data/Canada.geojson")

yukon <- canada %>% 
  filter(PROV == "YT")

ggplot() +
  ggspatial::layer_spatial(canada,fill = "grey80", colour = "grey60") +
  ggspatial::layer_spatial(yukon,fill = "yellow", colour = "black") +
  ggspatial::annotation_north_arrow(location = "br",pad_y = unit(1,"cm"),pad_x = unit(0.7,"cm"), which_north = "true", style = north_arrow_orienteering()) +
  ggspatial::annotation_scale(location = "br",style = "ticks") +

  theme(legend.position = "none") +

```


# Objectives

1. Easy to use reproducible poster design. 
2. Integration with `RMarkdown`.
3. Easy transition from `posterdown` to `thesisdown` or `rticles`


# Methods

This package uses the same workflow approach as the `RMarkdown` you know and love. Basically it goes from RMarkdown > Knitr > Markdown > Pandoc > Latex > PDF.
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/ou-logo.png")
```

# Results

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calcualated. In posterdown this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical `RMarkdown` formatting. I suggesting checking out the `kableExtra` package and its in depth documentation on customizing these tables found [here](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf).

\vspace{5cm}

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)

data("iris")

kable(iris[1:4,],align = "c", caption = "Tables are a breeze with Kable and Kable extra package!", booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped","HOLD_position"),full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12)

```

```{r, out.width='80%', fig.height=6.0, fig.cap='Using ggplot and patchwork to generate a layout of multiple plots in one figure. The iris dataset was used to generate (a) a line graph, (b) a scatterplot, and (c) a boxplot all together!'}

library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(ggthemes)

theme_set(theme_gray() + theme_tufte() + theme(legend.position = "none"))

base <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species))
  
p_point <- base + geom_point()
p_line  <- base + geom_line() 
p_area  <- base + geom_area()
p_box1  <- ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species))
p_box2  <- ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, fill = Species))

p_line + 
  {p_point + p_box1} +
  plot_layout(ncol = 1) + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "a", tag_prefix = "(",tag_suffix = ")")

```

# Next Steps

There is still **A LOT** of work to do on this package which include (but are note limited to): 

- Better softcoding for front end user options in YAML
- Images in the title section for logo placement which is a common attribut to posters as far as I have come to know.
- Figure out compatiability with `natbib` which wasn't working during the initial set up.
- MUCH BETTER PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION. For example, there is nothing in the README...
- Include References section only if initiated by the user like in RMarkdown.

How about a neat table of data? See, Table \@ref(tab:iristable):

```{r, iristable}
knitr::kable(
  iris[1:15,1:5], format = "html",
  caption = "A table made with the **knitr::kable** function.",
  align = "c", col.names = c("Sepal <br> Length",
                             "Sepal <br> Width",
                             "Petal <br> Length",
                             "Petal <br> Width",
                             "Species"),
  escape = FALSE)
```
